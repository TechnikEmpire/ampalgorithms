AMP ALGORITHMS: C++ AMP Algorithms Library
 
This library contains collections of C++ AMP algorithms that can be useful building 
blocks for C++ AMP applications. 

The library is in the form of C++ header files that are available in "inc" directory.

To use the library:
1) add "inc" to INCLUDE, or use compiler switch "/I inc", 
   or add "inc" to "Include Directories" in visual studio project properties.
2) Add "include <amp_stl_algorthms>" in cpp source file. 
   (There may be new headers for additional algorithms that will be introduced in future)

To follow an example, please use the amp_algorithms.vcxproj as a guide to creating 
a project for using the C++ AMP algorithms.
